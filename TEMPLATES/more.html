                                <h3>Feeding your plants: Everything you need to know</h3>
                                
                                <p>Why do plants need feeding?</p>

                                    <p> Like any living thing, plants need water and food to survive. They make a lot of their food themselves, converting sunlight into energy, but that doesn’t give them all the nutrients they need to grow healthily. In the wild, plants would suck up nutrients from the soil. Those nutrients get constantly refreshed with rotting plant matter, animal/insect droppings and other delightful things. Obviously they don’t have access to those sorts of nutrients indoors. They only have what is in their potting soil. So we have to top that up with nutrients.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Regularly feeding your plants is equivalent to someone making sure you eat your five portions of fruit and vegetables. You'd survive without them, but you wouldn't be very healthy.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> What is plant food?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>First, a quick lesson: ‘plant food’ and ‘fertiliser’ are different terms for the same thing. Fertiliser is just the slightly more science-y word. Manufactured plant food can contain lots of things, but it typically has three key ingredients:</p>
                                    
                                    <p> Nitrogen - Encourages strong growth</p>
                                    
                                    <p> Phosphorous - Helps your plant produce stronger roots and healthy flowers</p>
                                    
                                    <p> Potassium - Helps your plant fight off disease</p>
                                    
                                    <p> For indoor plants, plant food is typically a liquid that you mix with water and then pour over your plant’s soil (food for outdoor plants is sometimes in the form of granules you mix into the soil). </p>
                                    
                                    <p> How often do plants need to be fed?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>When you buy a plant from Patch it will be potted in nutrient rich compost. It has all the nutrients it needs for a while, so you won’t need to feed it for at least three months.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Plants are not hungry year round. They only need to be fed in the months when they’re growing, in spring and summer. For most plants, a feed once per month in spring and summer will be perfect. When the weather is colder, in autumn and winter, most plants will be ‘dormant’, i.e. sleeping, and not growing, so they don’t need food. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Some plants are less hungry and need lighter food. Mostly that's cacti, like Spike or Ian. They prefer a cactus-specific feed. If your plant has any specific feeding needs, you'll find them on its product page.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Feeding your plants is really easy and takes very little time at all. But that tiny bit of extra effort will make the world of difference and you'll get much bigger, stronger plants.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>For more on feeding, take a look at our plant care videos. We have videos to cover just about any plant-related question you might have.</p>

                                <h3>plants are affected by too little or too much light ! </h3>

                                </div>
                                <p>When plants lack light, they don't produce chlorophyll (the green pigment in plants), and plants can turn pale green to yellow to white.</p>
                                <p>Plant stems become “leggy,” meaning stems become long and thin and appear to be reaching toward the source of light.</p>
                                <p>A lack of sufficient light causes the plant to grow long spaces on stems between the leaf nodes (the point where a leaf grows out from the stem).</p>
                                <p>Plants without sufficient light may also drop their leaves, especially older leaves.</p>
                                <p>You may find that a variegated plant (leaves that are white and green) may revert to being solid green.</p>
                                <p>Flowering plants may fail to produce flower buds.</p>
                                <p>Plants exposed to too much light may result in scorched and bleached leaves.</p>

                                </div>
                                <h3>1. ​Choose plants based on your light</h3>
                                
                                    <p>Are the plants you love the ones you can have? Our #1 rule of (green) thumb is to determine the amount of natural lightyour space receives, and to choose your plant accordingly. If you’re not sure just by looking, start by figuring out which direction your windows face.</p>
                                <h3>2.​ Pick plants that work with your schedule</h3>
                                    <p>If you’ve got more time, you can try a few attention-loving air plants, orchids, or ferns. Like a mist for the face, an extra spritz of filtered water daily between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for these delicate plants.</p>
                                <h3>3.​ ​Be mindful when watering</h3>
                                    <p>It’s better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your watering schedule and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the potting mix or soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it’s thing for now.</p>
                                    <p>Always use warm water because it absorbs best. Pour water directly on the soil around the base of the plant, because plants absorb water from their roots. The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air plants, who absorb water through their leaves.</p>
                                <h3>4.​ ​Know when to skip the fertilizer</h3>
                                    <p>If you have had your plant for at least year, you can fertilize it for the first time. We suggest using an all-purpose fertilizer. Always follow the instructions. If you’ve just changed the soil, skip the fertilizer! Fresh soil has enough new nutrients.</p>
                                    <p>Be mindful when using fertilizer on your houseplants. Too much fertilizer can do more harm than good. Houseplants tend to not need fertilizer as often as outdoor plants do. If you do choose to fertilize your plant, it’s best to do so during the growing season (early spring to early fall) and follow the general rule of thumb: ‘less is more’. Most store-​bought fertilizers should be diluted with water before use.</p>
